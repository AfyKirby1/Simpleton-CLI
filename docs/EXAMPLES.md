## üìä Success Metrics and Best Practices

### Measuring Success

1. **Time Saved**: Track how much development time AI CLI saves
2. **Code Quality**: Monitor improvements in code quality metrics
3. **Learning**: Note new concepts and patterns learned
4. **Productivity**: Measure tasks completed vs. time invested

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple tasks and gradually increase complexity
2. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed prompts for better results
3. **Iterate**: Use follow-up questions to refine solutions
4. **Verify**: Always review AI suggestions before applying
5. **Learn**: Use AI CLI as a learning tool, not just a code generator

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-reliance**: Don't lose fundamental coding skills
2. **Blind Trust**: Always understand the code before using it
3. **Wrong Model**: Use appropriate model size for task complexity
4. **Poor Prompts**: Vague prompts lead to vague solutions
5. **No Testing**: Always test AI-generated code thoroughly
